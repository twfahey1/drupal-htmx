# Drupal HTMX Example
This module was a fun exploration into HTMX, and how I might integrate it with Drupal. It is not intended to be used in production, but rather as a learning tool. When turning on the module, you'll have a block based on an example from HTMX for editing a contact. The block leverages theme functions defined in the module file to implement twig templates, where we simply put the HTML we want to use for HTMX, along with the attached htmx library defined in the libraries.yml file. The block also leverages a custom controller to handle the form submission, and return the updated block content.
